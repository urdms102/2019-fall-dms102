# Lab 3: Name Processor

Due: today (Tuesday, September 12, 2019)

This assignment tests your ability to demonstrate various text manipulation techniques using Python.

## Step 1: Create a new Python file using a template

Create a new Python file named lab03.py and fill it with the following starter code:

```python
# ********************
# Lab 3: Name Processor
# ********************
# define the function here (with a meaningful function name) and have it 
#    accept one parameter...


  # on one line convert the input to all lowercase (from Program 18, page 53)
  #   and save the result in a variable
  
  
  # on one line count the CHARACTERS in the inputted name (from Program 24, page 59)
  #   and save the result in a variable
  
  
  # count the WORDS in the inputted name (from Program 32, page 64)
  #   use as many lines as you need, then save the result in a variable



  # count the WORDS in the inputted name WITHOUT spaces
  #   use as many lines as you need, then save the result in a variable
  #   HINT: you might want to use a "pile" variable and multiple FOR 
  #   statements, one FOR nested inside another FOR





  # Reverse the input (from Program 27, page 61)
  #   use as many lines as you need, then save the result in a variable
  #   HINT: you might want to use a "pile" variable

    

  # Print out everything onto four lines with labels so it matches the example in 
  #    the instructions
  print "You name has " + str(___________) + " parts to it"
  print "Your name has " + str(___________) + " characters (including spaces)"
  print "Your name has " + str(___________) + " characters (without spaces)"
  print "Your name backwards is: " + ___________ #use the .title() method

# ********************
# TEST
# ********************
# Ask the user to enter their name using raw_input(), then run the program


```

Working as a class, fill out the areas indicated with code to end up with a program that creates output like this:

```python
>>> 
======= Loading Program =======
Enter your name: Robert Martin Kostin
You name has 3 parts to it
Your name has 20 characters (including spaces)
Your name has 18 characters (without spaces)
Your name backwards is: Nitsok Nitram Trebor
>>> 
```


### Turn-in the Assignment for Credit

1. When your program is working correctly, open a web browser and navigate to our DMS 102 section in Blackboard; in the "Lab Assignments" area find "Lab 3: Name Processor"
3. Upload your **lab03.py** file to the Lab 3 assignment
