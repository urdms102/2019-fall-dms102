# In-Class Lab 5: Sound Modification

*Due: Thursday, November 7, 2019 (today)*

This assignment tests your ability to modify sample in sound files using Python.

Follow the steps below, writing and saving the code for each step in a new Python file.   

## Requirements

- [ ] STEP 1: Record a new sound of speech (2 or 3 seconds) and save it as a WAV

- [ ] STEP 2: Take-in that WAV file into JES and turn it into a sound object.  Then "explore" the sound object.


- [ ] STEP 3: Normalize the sound object, and "explore" it again.
  
  
  - HINT: normalize is program 97 (page 228)
  
- [ ] STEP 4: Take the normalized sound object and write a program that...
  - increases all the positive values (multiply by 2) and 
  - decreases the volume for all the negative values (divide by 2).  
  - Then "explore" the sound file again. 
  
  HINT: a program that's similar to STEP 4 is Program 98 (page 229)

*Answer the question (to yourself): can you still understand the words?*

- [ ] STEP 5: Take the same sound object and write another program that...
  - Sets all the negative values to zero. 
  - "Explore" the sound file again.  

*How about now? Can you still understand the words?*

### Turn-in the Assignment for Credit

1. When your program is working correctly, ZIP (compress) your program file and the WAV file you used
2. Go into our DMS 102 section in Blackboard; in the "Lab Assignments" area find "Lab 5: Sound Modification"
3. Upload your ZIP file to the Lab 5 assignment
