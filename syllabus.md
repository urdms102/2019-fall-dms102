| Activity                                                     | Weight of the final grade                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **In-class Labs and Participation**<br>There are multiple participation events at various times during the semester at the discretion of the instructor.<br>- In-class exercises are checked for completion<br>- In-class quizzes (few questions, limited time) every so often | **30%**<br> Each participation event counts equally toward the total of 30%.  There will be between 10 and 15 participation events.  Nonattendance at a classroom session during a participation event will result in a zero for that event. |
| **Assignments** (homework)<br> There is take-home work to be turned-in on Blackboard usually every week at the discretion of the instructor.  Each assignment counts equally toward the total of 40%.  There are between 10 and 15 assignments. | **40%**<br> Each assignment is worth 3.0 to 4.5% of the overall grade depending on how many there are |
| **Exams**<br>There is a midterm and a final exam, both worth 15% of the final grade.  The final exam is not comprehensive, but given the nature of the topic, it is important to know the course material from the first half of the semester. | **30%**<br>Midterm exam: 15%<br>Final exam: 15%              |

# Assignments and In-class Exercises

**Lab Sessions:** this course uses a combined lecture/lab session.  Labs will be introduced and discussed during the same classroom time as the lecture, and time will be set aside for students to work and get help.

**Take-home Assignments** are made available via Blackboard during the lectures and can be completed in the dedicated lab time or independently on the student's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).  

**Help:** to get help on any assignment or project, the student must be in the lecture/lab classroom.

## Due Dates

For each assignment, the **due date** is shown on page 1 near the top. To avoid a zero grade, each must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before its due date.  

## Late assignments

Late assignments will not be graded unless a *prior* arrangement has been made with the professor to give you an **extension by one or two days** based on the discretion of the Professor.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the professor. 

The grade for assignments not turned-in on time with no prior arrangement for an extension will be zero.

# Texts and Materials

Required text: **Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python, A Multimedia Approach**, Forth Edition, by Mark J. Guzdial and Barbara Ericson, ISBN-13: 978-0134025544

## Software

Students will use software provided by the instructor: **JES (Jython Environment for Students)** for Windows and Mac OS

Students may install the software on their own computer AND/OR install the software on a thumb drive and use the computers provided by the University. (A thumb drive works very well and is obviously more portable than bringing one's own laptop to every class.)

# Academic Honesty

Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003,](http://wpacouncil.org/node/9)). More specifically for CSC 170, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices

In the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of inspiration.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  Students must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as their own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.  For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)

## Academic Assistance and Accommodations

Please know that this classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. Students are invited to talk with the professor about any concern or situation that affects their ability to complete their academic work successfully. Useful resources for all students include the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, located at **1-154 Dewey Hall** on the River Campus; telephone: **(585) 275-9049** or email <cetl@rochester.edu>

# Communication

The professor will use **Slack** to make course‑related announcements and to distribute assignments.  Students are required to monitor Slack for announcements daily.  

Students may also use Slack to ask questions and get help from the professor.

- Sign-up for access to the CSC 170 Slack Workspace here: [join.slack.com/t/dms-102/signup](https://join.slack.com/t/dms-102/signup)

  - Students must use their **rochester.edu** email when signing-up for access

- After the student has created their account, they can access the *CSC 170 Slack Workspace* here: [dms-102.slack.com](https://dms-102.slack.com/) 

  - Consider bookmarking that address
  - For faster access, consider installing the Slack application for Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android


  - Also consider turning-on Slack notifications in the smartphone app
    - Notifications can be customized so the student is not overwhelmed with notifications
