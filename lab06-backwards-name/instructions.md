# In-Class Lab 6: Backwards Name

*Due: Thursday, November 12, 2019 (today)*

The point of this lab is to practice juggling multiple, relatively abstracted functions in a program to accomplish a goal.  

- [ ] Create a new Python file

- [ ] Copy-in the code from **Lab 3: Name Processor**

- [ ] Change the name of the main function from `nameStats()` to `backwardsName()`

- [ ] Remove everything in the function *except* the parts to:
  - turn the input into lower case letters
  - reverse the inputted string
  - print the name backwards while using "title case"

- [ ] Also in the new Python file, add the function to normalize a sound

- [ ] Also add the function to reverse a sound

In the TEST block...

- [ ] Ask the user to enter their name
- [ ] Ask the user to pick a sound file (a WAV file of you, saying your name)
- [ ] Normalize the WAV sound file
- [ ] Reverse the WAV sound file
- [ ] Run the `backwardsName()` program using the inputted name
- [ ] Play the reversed sound file

### Turn-in the Assignment for Credit

- When your program is working correctly, ZIP (compress) your program file and the WAV file you used
- Go into our DMS 102 section in Blackboard; in the "Lab Assignments" area find **Lab 6: Backwards Name**
- Upload your ZIP file to the Lab 6 assignment
